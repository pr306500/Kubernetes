l. What is Kubernetes ?
   It's a system for running different types of containers n different number of containers over 
   several different computers / VM / nodes.

2. Why use Kubernetes ?
   When we need to run different containers with different images. 

In our current application we have 4 containers[nginx, server, client and worker]. The worker container is responsible for
algorithmic part hence if a lot of traffic comes then we need to scale up the worker container.

**. Scaling Strategy for Elatic BeanStalk .**
In this rather creating more copies of the specific container (video 169:3.00) what elastic beanstalk actually
does, it may create 2,3,4 or 5 different sets of all of our containers.
As per the Elastic BeanStalk approach we will have [nginx, server, client] containers more in number but they might not 
be the limiting factor.

Kubernetive Cluster: Cluster in the world of kubernetes is assembly of something called master and one or more nodes(VM).(video:169:5:04)
Node is a VM that will be used to run some number of different containers. In the world of Kubernetives all these different nodes are
managed by Master. Master has set of program running to control what each of these different Nodes are running at any given point of time.
 
Kubernetes is best when we need to run multiple different types of containers but if we have an application that would have largely 
just one type of container inside of it, Kubernetes might not be the best solution for it.

                            *********WORKING With Kubernetes**********

In Dev Env we use minikube and it's a cmd line tool whose sole purpose is to setup kubernetes cluster on our local system
In Prod Env, we freq make use of managed solution, they are the references to outside cloud providers such as AWS. AWS has a 
service to implement kubernetes i.e. A.Elastic.Container .

Minikube is going to create a kubernete cluster on our local machine basically it's going to create a VM(nodes) behind the scene
whose sole purpose is to run the container.

Kubectl is used to tell a VM what sort of containers it's supposed to be running (instruction rel to node exec) or essentially manage what
node is doing (status). Minikube is just used to create and run a kubernetes cluster on our local machine but in prod env it falls away. 

Local Kubernetes Development:
Install Kubectl (cli for interacting with master) >> Install a VM driver virtual box >> install minikube (runs a single node on that VM) 

GOAL: To run multi-client image on our local Kubernetes Cluster(set of nodes n master) running inside the container.
